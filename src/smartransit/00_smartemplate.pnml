/* This is the template. When you're more experienced, you can try editing this, but if it's all gibberish then just modify "FooBarTramVehicleTemplates.png" in GIMP to create a vehicle. Each template below refers to a specific vehicle length, so make sure to put the vehicle sprites in the right part of "FooBarTramVehicleTemplates.png" when drawing a vehicle. */
